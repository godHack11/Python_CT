# Student Score Prediction using Regression
# This project aims to predict students' exam scores based on features such as the number of hours studied, previous exam 
# scores, and attendance. Regression techniques will be used to build a model that estimates the exam score of a student given
# these input features. The project can provide insights into factors influencing student performance and help educators 
# identify students who may need additional support.
