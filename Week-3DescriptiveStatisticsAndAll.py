# 1. Descriptive Statistics

# Summarizes and describes features of a dataset.
# Measures of central tendency: mean, median, mode
# Measures of variability: variance, standard deviation, range, interquartile range
# Data visualization: histograms, box plots, bar charts

⸻

# 2. Inferential Statistics

# Makes conclusions or predictions about a population based on a sample.
# Hypothesis testing
# Confidence intervals
# Regression analysis
# ANOVA (Analysis of Variance)

⸻

# 3. Correlation

# Measures strength and direction of relationship between two variables.
# Pearson’s correlation coefficient (r): linear correlation (-1 to +1)
# Spearman’s rank correlation: non-parametric version for ordinal data or non-linear monotonic relationships

⸻

# 4. Regression Analysis

# Models relationship between dependent variable and one or more independent variables.
# Simple Linear Regression: one predictor
# Multiple Regression: multiple predictors
# Estimates how changes in predictors affect the outcome

⸻

# 5. Analysis of Variance (ANOVA)

# Tests whether means of three or more groups are significantly different.
# One-way ANOVA: one factor
# Two-way ANOVA: two factors
# Checks for interaction effects between factors

⸻

# 6. Non-parametric Tests

# Used when data doesn’t meet assumptions of parametric tests (like normality).
# Mann-Whitney U test: compares two independent samples
# Wilcoxon signed-rank test: paired samples
# Kruskal-Wallis test: non-parametric ANOVA alternative

⸻

# 7. Time Series Analysis

# Analyzes data points collected or recorded at time intervals.
# Trend analysis
# Seasonal decomposition
# Forecasting models like ARIMA, Exponential Smoothing

⸻

# 8. Experimental Design

# Planning how to collect data to make valid, reliable conclusions.
# Randomization
# Control groups
# Replication
# Blocking to reduce variability

⸻

# 9. Statistical Modeling

# Using mathematical models to represent complex data relationships.
# Linear/non-linear regression
# Generalized linear models (GLM)
# Mixed-effects models

⸻

# 10. Statistical Inference

# Drawing conclusions about populations from sample data.
# Estimation (point & interval)
# Hypothesis testing
# P-values and significance levels

⸻

# 11. Bayesian Statistics

# Framework for updating beliefs based on evidence using Bayes’ theorem.
# Prior, likelihood, posterior
# Bayesian inference vs frequentist methods
# Used in machine learning, decision making
