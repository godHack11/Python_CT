# Implement a Linked List in Python Using OOP and Delete the Nth Node

# Create a Python program that implements a singly linked list using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. 
# Your implementation should include the following: A Node class to represent each node in the list. A LinkedList class to manage the 
# nodes, with methods to: Add a node to the end of the list Print the list Delete the nth node (where n is a 1-based index) Include 
# exception handling to manage edge cases such as: Deleting a node from an empty list Deleting a node with an index out of range Test 
# your implementation with at least one sample list.

# What This Code Does:

# It creates and manages a singly linked list using Python and OOP (Object-Oriented Programming). It allows you to:
# 1. Add items (nodes) at the end
# 2. Print all items in the list
# 3. Delete any item by its position (like 1st, 2nd, 3rd…)
# 4. Handles errors properly (like empty list or wrong position)

# Main Parts of the Code:
# 1. Node class

# This is like a building block. Each node stores:
# • data → the value (like 10, 20)
# • next → a pointer to the next node (or None if it’s the last one)

# 2. LinkedList class

# This manages the whole list. It has:
# • A starting point called head
# • A method add_node(data) to add a value to the end
# • A method print_list() to display the list
# • A method delete_nth_node(n) to delete the node at position n
